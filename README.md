# Tasks completed during my Data Science Internship at Encryptix

‚õ¥Ô∏è `Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction` 
Using machine learning techniques, I developed a model to predict survival rates aboard the Titanic. 
By analyzing passenger data, I gained insights into factors influencing survival, contributing to disaster preparedness strategies. 

üé¨ `TASK 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python` 
Implemented a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, cast, and user reviews. 
This project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying linear regression to forecast ratings accurately. 
The insights gained contribute to improving movie recommendations and understanding audience preferences. 

üå∏ `Task 3: IRIS Flower Classification`
Developed a classification model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal dimensions. 
Through extensive data analysis, model training, and evaluation, this project enhanced my skills in supervised learning and pattern recognition, enabling precise species identification. 

üìà `Task 4: Sales Prediction`
Utilized machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict future sales based on historical data and external factors like economic indicators and seasonal trends. 
By implementing this model with pandas, numpy, sklearn, and visualizing results using matplotlib, I provided valuable insights for business planning and inventory management strategies.

üîç `Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection`
Implemented a robust fraud detection system using Logistic Regression to identify suspicious credit card transactions. 
This involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation using metrics like precision and recall. 
By leveraging machine learning algorithms and streamlit for interactive visualization, I contributed to enhancing financial security measures and reducing fraudulent activities
